    Service for cross-chain transfers on fungible and non-fungible tokens
    
    ## How to transfer tokens
    
    1. Get the list of supported tokens and chains with the [GET /tokens](#operation/getTokenList) method or [GET /chains](#operation/getChainList).
    2. Select token that you want to transfer
    3. On first transfer you need to check if bridge contract is allowed to use your token. Use [POST /transfers/approve](#operation/approveToken) method to build transaction to approve bridge contract. If you already approved bridge contract you will get 204 status code. Sign and send transaction sing your wallet.
    4. Use [POST /transfers/lock](#operation/lockRequest) method to build transaction to lock tokens on source chain. Sign and send transaction sing your wallet.
    5. Wait until transaction will be finalized on source chain. To check if transaction finalized make a request to [POST /transfers/redeem](#operation/redeem) you will get 400 error with proper description if transaction is not finalized.
    6. After transaction finalized make a request to [POST /transfers/redeem](#operation/redeem) method to build transaction to redeem tokens on destination chain. Sign and send transaction sing your wallet.
    
    ## Redeem
    
    In some cases user may not finish transfer flow, for such problems we have separate redeem feature. User could provide locking transaction hash to [POST /transfers/redeem](#operation/redeem) token and backend will get all needed data from blockchain. The flow is same to redeem in normal flow.
    
    ## Read methods
    
    Service contains some read methods that could be used to get some useful info for client:
    
    - [GET /tokens/{token}/balance](#operation/getBalance)
    - [GET /tokens/{token}/nfts/{nft_id}](#operation/getNFT)
    - [GET /tokens/{token}/decimals](#operation/getDecimals)
